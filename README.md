# Behavior ML Analysis

Contains DLC tracks, behavior annodations (in BORIS) and trained DLC models for 10 mouse social interaction videos.

Labeling matches the multi-agent behavior analysis challenge [here](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/multi-agent-behavior-representation-modeling-measurement-and-applications/).

Includes notebooks that run DLC inference for a batch of videos. Once inference is performed, also includes notebooks that can perform supervised or unsupervised learning.
